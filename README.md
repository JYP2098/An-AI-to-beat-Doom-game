# An-AI-to-beat-Doom-game
The environment of the game is taken from OpenGym.ai

The files are created on Spyder(Python IDE) with Anaconda.

Training the model takes fair amount of time considering the CPU/GPU you use.

As your compile the program, the AI explores various ways of beating the game, and the gameplay will be stored in the videos folder, depicting the various scenarios of how well our AI is performing.
Enjoy!!
